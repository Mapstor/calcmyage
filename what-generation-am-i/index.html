    <!-- How Generations Are Defined -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>How Are Generation Boundaries Defined?</h2>
      <p>Generation boundaries are not arbitrary - they're set by researchers based on <strong>shared formative experiences</strong>. The <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>, the most widely cited source, uses these criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Millennial/Gen Z boundary (1996/1997):</strong> People born 1996 or earlier were old enough to remember 9/11; those born 1997 or later generally were not.</li>
        <li><strong>Gen Z/Gen Alpha boundary (2012/2013):</strong> Those born 2012 or earlier remember life before tablets and voice assistants became ubiquitous; those born 2013 or later do not.</li>
        <li><strong>Gen X/Millennial boundary (1980/1981):</strong> Those born 1980 or earlier had analog childhoods; those born 1981 or later grew up with increasing digital technology.</li>
        <li><strong>Boomer/Gen X boundary (1964/1965):</strong> Aligned with the end of the post-WWII birth rate surge.</li>
      </ul>
