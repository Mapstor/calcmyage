        "text": "The age of 13 comes directly from COPPA. Because COPPA requires parental consent before collecting personal data from children under 13, most platforms simply set 13 as their minimum age to avoid the compliance burden. It is easier to exclude users under 13 entirely than to build and maintain a system for obtaining verifiable parental consent for each young user. This is why you see 13 as the minimum age on virtually every major platform from YouTube to TikTok to Instagram."

However, if the platform discovers the user is underage (through reports, content analysis, or other means), it is required to delete the account and all associated data under COPPA. Platforms are increasingly investing in AI-based age estimation tools to detect underage users, but these systems are not perfect.

If a company based in Europe or Asia operates a service that collects data from children in the US, it must comply with COPPA. In practice, because the internet is global, most major platforms comply with COPPA regardless of their headquarters location. Other countries have their own child protection laws (GDPR in the EU, Digital Personal Data Protection Act in India) that may have different age thresholds."

The AI analyzes features like skin texture, wrinkle patterns, facial proportions, and other age-related characteristics. Modern systems can typically estimate age within a margin of 2-3 years for adults and 1-2 years for children and teens. The technology does not identify who the person is -- it only estimates their age. Companies like Yoti and VerifyMyAge provide this as a service to platforms that need age verification."

In the UK, the Gambling Commission requires operators to verify age before allowing any gambling, using methods like ID document verification, credit reference agency checks, and database matching. In the US, state-regulated online gambling platforms require government ID upload and may cross-reference with public records. Most also use geolocation to ensure the user is in a jurisdiction where online gambling is legal. The age threshold is typically 18 in the UK and most countries, and 21 in many US states."

This is useful when you need to know precisely whether you meet an age threshold. For official verification purposes, your birth certificate, passport, or government ID serves as the authoritative source of your date of birth. If there is ever a discrepancy between your actual age and what a platform believes your age to be, contact the platform's support team with official documentation."

Age verification can be done anonymously (e.g., facial age estimation that only determines if someone appears over 18 without identifying them). Identity verification typically requires matching a person to official records (name, address, ID number). Some systems combine both -- verifying identity and extracting age from the ID document simultaneously. The distinction matters for privacy: age verification can preserve anonymity in ways that full identity verification cannot."

Under COPPA, platforms can allow children under 13 if they obtain verifiable parental consent first -- this is what YouTube Kids and Roblox do, for example. However, some platforms simply prohibit all users under 13 regardless of parental consent. For age-restricted content like gambling or adult material, parental consent typically cannot override legal age requirements. Platforms like Apple's Family Sharing and Google's Family Link allow parents to control app access, but this is parental oversight rather than formal age verification override."

For threshold verification (e.g., determining if someone is over 18), systems can achieve 98%+ accuracy for people who are clearly over or under the threshold. Accuracy decreases for people near the threshold age and can vary by demographic -- some systems have shown bias based on skin tone, gender, or facial features. The UK's Age Verification Providers Association (AVPA) requires certified providers to meet specific accuracy standards. For critical applications, AI estimation is often combined with ID verification for uncertain cases."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Data retention practices vary significantly by provider and jurisdiction. Under GDPR and similar laws, providers should retain data only as long as necessary and disclose retention periods in their privacy policies. Best-practice providers delete raw images and documents immediately after verification, retaining only the verification result (over/under threshold). Some providers use \"data minimization\" approaches where only the yes/no result is stored, and no personal data is retained. Always check the provider's privacy policy, and in the EU, you have the right to request deletion under GDPR Article 17."

      <!-- SECTION 1: What Is Age Verification -->
      <h2 id="what-is">What Is Age Verification?</h2>
      <p>Age verification is the process of confirming that a person meets a minimum age requirement before granting them access to products, services, or content. It is one of the most common applications of age calculation in the modern world, affecting everything from buying alcohol at a store to signing up for a social media account.</p>

      <p>Age verification exists because different activities carry different levels of risk, and society has decided that people below certain ages should not engage in those activities without additional protections. The specific age thresholds and verification methods vary depending on the context and jurisdiction. For a comprehensive overview of what ages unlock what rights, see our <a href="/blog/legal-ages-guide/">Legal Ages Guide</a>.</p>

      <p>In the physical world, age verification is relatively straightforward: a clerk checks your government-issued ID. Online, the challenge is much harder. How do you prove someone is actually 13, or 18, or 21 when they are sitting behind a screen? This question has driven an entire industry of age verification technologies and prompted governments worldwide to create new regulations.</p>

      <h3>Why Age Verification Matters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Child protection:</strong> Prevents children from accessing harmful content (violence, pornography, gambling) and protects their personal data from collection by companies.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> Businesses face significant fines and legal liability if they fail to verify ages where required by law. COPPA violations can result in penalties of over $50,000 per incident.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial regulation:</strong> Banks and financial services must verify customer ages as part of anti-money-laundering (AML) and fraud prevention requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Public health:</strong> Age gates on alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis websites help maintain compliance with age-restricted product laws.</li>
        <li><strong>Contractual validity:</strong> Contracts signed by minors may not be legally enforceable, giving businesses a strong incentive to verify that their customers are of legal age.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- SECTION 2: COPPA -->
      <h2 id="coppa">COPPA Explained: Protecting Children Under 13</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong> is a US federal law enacted in 1998 and enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). It is the single most influential piece of legislation in shaping how websites and apps handle young users, and its impact extends far beyond the United States.</p>

      <h3>What Does COPPA Require?</h3>
      <p>COPPA applies to operators of websites and online services directed at children under 13, or operators of general audience sites that have actual knowledge they are collecting personal information from children under 13. The law requires:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Verifiable parental consent:</strong> Before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from a child under 13, the operator must obtain verifiable consent from a parent or legal guardian.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear privacy policy:</strong> Operators must post a clear, comprehensive privacy policy describing their data practices for children's information.</li>
        <li><strong>Data minimization:</strong> Operators may not collect more personal information from children than is reasonably necessary to provide the service.</li>
        <li><strong>Data security:</strong> Reasonable measures must be taken to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of children's personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>Parental rights:</strong> Parents must be given the ability to review their child's information, request deletion, and refuse further collection.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why Age 13?</h3>
      <p>The age threshold of 13 was chosen as a compromise during the legislative process. Child development experts suggested that children younger than 13 generally lack the cognitive maturity to understand privacy implications and consent to data collection. At the same time, setting the threshold higher (such as 16 or 18) was seen as potentially too restrictive for the internet industry. The result was 13 -- an age that has since become the de facto minimum age for most social media platforms worldwide.</p>

      <h3>COPPA Enforcement and Penalties</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FTC enforces COPPA</a> and has taken action against numerous companies for violations. Notable enforcement actions include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>TikTok (2019):</strong> $5.7 million fine for collecting personal information from children under 13 without parental consent -- the largest COPPA fine at that time.</li>
        <li><strong>YouTube/Google (2019):</strong> $170 million settlement for tracking children's viewing habits without parental consent to serve them targeted advertising.</li>
        <li><strong>Epic Games/Fortnite (2022):</strong> $275 million settlement for violating COPPA through its default privacy settings and the way it collected data from young players.</li>
        <li><strong>Microsoft/Xbox (2023):</strong> $20 million fine for collecting and retaining personal data from children who signed up for Xbox Live accounts.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In 2024, the FTC finalized an updated COPPA rule that strengthened requirements around targeted advertising to children, expanded the definition of personal information to include biometric data, and introduced new requirements for educational technology companies. These updates reflect the rapidly evolving digital landscape since COPPA was originally enacted.</p>

      <h3>COPPA vs. International Child Protection Laws</h3>
      <p>While COPPA was a pioneering law, other countries have enacted their own child data protection regulations. Understanding these differences is crucial for global platforms. For more on international age thresholds, see our <a href="/blog/legal-ages-guide/">legal ages guide</a>.</p>

      <h2>History of Age Verification</h2>
      <p>Age verification is not a new concept -- it has evolved alongside technology and changing social norms. Understanding this history helps contextualize current debates.</p>

      <h3>Pre-Internet Era (Before 1990s)</h3>
      <p>Before the internet, age verification was primarily a physical process. Merchants selling alcohol, tobacco, or adult magazines would check government-issued IDs. Movie theaters enforced MPAA ratings by asking for ID at R-rated films. This system worked because transactions were face-to-face and ID documents were difficult to forge.</p>

      <h3>Early Internet (1990s-2000s)</h3>
      <p>The first websites with age-restricted content (gambling, adult material) used simple self-declaration: "Click here if you are over 18." This was widely recognized as ineffective but was considered sufficient for legal compliance in most jurisdictions. The phrase "I certify that I am 18 years or older" became ubiquitous.</p>

      <h3>Social Media Era (2000s-2010s)</h3>
      <p>The rise of social media created new challenges. COPPA's passage in 1998 (effective 2000) led platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and later Instagram to implement birthday fields at registration. However, enforcement was minimal -- children routinely lied about their age, and platforms had little incentive to verify.</p>

      <h3>Modern Era (2010s-Present)</h3>
      <p>Increasing concerns about child safety, data privacy, and online harms have driven a new wave of age verification technologies and regulations. Biometric age estimation, digital ID systems, and stricter laws are reshaping the landscape. The <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Security Administration</a> and other government agencies are exploring digital identity solutions that could transform age verification.</p>

      <h2>Celebrity Age Verification Stories</h2>
      <p>Even famous individuals have encountered age verification challenges, highlighting how universal these issues are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Billie Eilish (born December 18, 2001):</strong> The Grammy-winning artist was only 13 when she uploaded "Ocean Eyes" to SoundCloud. As a minor, her parents had to manage her social media presence and business dealings under COPPA and California's Coogan Law.</li>
        <li><strong>Ryan Kaji (born October 6, 2011):</strong> The star of Ryan's World YouTube channel has been the subject of FTC complaints about COPPA compliance, illustrating the challenges of child influencers.</li>
        <li><strong>Jojo Siwa (born May 19, 2003):</strong> Started her career as a child performer and had to navigate age-restricted platform policies throughout her teen years.</li>
        <li><strong>Millie Bobby Brown (born February 19, 2004):</strong> The Stranger Things actress joined Instagram at 12, requiring Meta's policies for accounts of minors with parental oversight.</li>

      <!-- SECTION 3: KYC -->
      <h2 id="kyc">KYC (Know Your Customer) Age Requirements</h2>
      <p><strong>Know Your Customer (KYC)</strong> is a set of regulations requiring financial institutions and other regulated businesses to verify the identity -- including the age -- of their customers. While KYC is primarily designed to prevent money laundering, terrorism financing, and fraud, age verification is an essential component because minors typically cannot enter into binding financial contracts.</p>

      <h3>Where KYC Age Checks Apply</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Banking:</strong> Opening a bank account, applying for credit cards, taking out loans</li>
        <li><strong>Investment:</strong> Brokerage accounts, cryptocurrency exchanges, trading platforms</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Purchasing insurance policies</li>
        <li><strong>Gambling:</strong> Online casinos, sports betting platforms, lottery websites</li>
        <li><strong>Fintech:</strong> Payment apps, peer-to-peer lending, digital wallets</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>KYC Age Thresholds</h3>
      <p>In most jurisdictions, the minimum age for financial services is the age of majority (18 in most countries). Some specific thresholds include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bank accounts:</strong> Most banks allow custodial accounts for minors (with a parent co-signer) but require the account holder to be 18 for an independent account.</li>
        <li><strong>Cryptocurrency exchanges:</strong> Nearly all require users to be 18+. Major platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken verify age through government ID during the KYC process.</li>
        <li><strong>Gambling:</strong> 18 in most countries; 21 in some US states for casino gambling.</li>
        <li><strong>Stock trading:</strong> 18 in the US and most countries. Custodial accounts (UTMA/UGMA) allow parents to invest on behalf of minors.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- SECTION 4: Online Platform Ages -->
      <h2 id="platforms">Online Platform Age Requirements</h2>
      <p>Most major online platforms set minimum age requirements, primarily to comply with COPPA and similar international regulations. The following table shows the stated minimum age for popular platforms:</p>

      <table class="data-table">
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Platform</th><th>Minimum Age</th><th>Verification Method</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
        </thead>

          <tr><td>Pinterest</td><td>13</td><td>Self-declared</td><td>Limited features for teen accounts</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Twitch</td><td>13</td><td>Self-declared date of birth</td><td>Mature content requires being 18+</td></tr>
          <tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td>16</td><td>Self-declared</td><td>Higher threshold for professional network</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Roblox</td><td>No minimum</td><td>Age-tiered content</td><td>Parental controls; 13+ for social features</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Apple App Store</td><td>13 (Apple ID)</td><td>Family Sharing for under-13</td><td>Child accounts managed by parents</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Google</td><td>13</td><td>Self-declared; supervised accounts for younger</td><td>Family Link for parental oversight</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>The overwhelming pattern is clear: 13 is the standard minimum age for most platforms, directly reflecting COPPA's threshold. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) allows member states to set their own minimum age for data processing consent between 13 and 16. Many EU countries chose 16, which is why WhatsApp and some other platforms have higher age requirements in Europe.</p>

      <p>It is worth noting that self-declared age verification is widely acknowledged to be ineffective. A child who wants to access a platform can simply enter a false date of birth. This has led to increasing pressure from governments and advocacy groups for stronger verification methods.</p>

      <h3>Platform Age Verification Effectiveness</h3>
      <p>Research by the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OECD</a> and academic institutions has attempted to measure how effective different platforms are at preventing underage access:</p>

      <!-- SECTION 5: Methods -->
      <h2 id="methods">Methods of Age Verification</h2>
      <p>The technology and methodology for verifying age online has evolved significantly, ranging from minimal friction (click a button) to high friction (submit government ID). Here is a breakdown of the main approaches:</p>

      <h3>1. Self-Declaration (Age Gates)</h3>
      <p>The simplest and most common method: the user enters their date of birth or clicks a checkbox confirming they meet the age requirement. This is used by virtually all social media platforms and most alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis websites.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Zero friction, no privacy concerns, free to implement, universal</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Easily bypassed by entering a false age; provides no actual verification</li>
        <li><strong>Used by:</strong> Most social media, age-restricted product websites, content platforms</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Government ID Verification</h3>
      <p>The user uploads a photo of a government-issued ID (driver's license, passport, national ID card), which is checked against databases or analyzed by software to extract and verify the date of birth.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> High accuracy; difficult to bypass; standard in financial services</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Significant privacy concerns; creates a database of sensitive documents; high friction deters users; accessibility issues for people without ID</li>
        <li><strong>Used by:</strong> Banks, cryptocurrency exchanges, gambling platforms, some social media (for specific features)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Credit Card Verification</h3>
      <p>Uses a credit card transaction (often a small charge that is immediately refunded) as a proxy for age, since credit cards generally require the holder to be 18 or older.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Reasonably effective as an 18+ gate; familiar to users; moderate friction</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Not available to everyone; prepaid cards can be obtained by minors; does not verify exact age</li>
        <li><strong>Used by:</strong> Some adult content sites, premium services, online purchases of age-restricted goods</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Biometric Facial Age Estimation</h3>
      <p>Uses artificial intelligence to estimate a person's age from a selfie or video. The system analyzes facial features associated with age (skin texture, bone structure, facial proportions) to produce an age estimate. This does not identify the person -- it only estimates their age range.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Does not require sharing personal documents; relatively quick; increasingly accurate</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Not 100% accurate (especially near threshold ages); privacy concerns around facial data; potential bias in algorithms across different demographics</li>
        <li><strong>Used by:</strong> Instagram (testing), some UK online age verification services, select retailers</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Digital Identity / Third-Party Verification</h3>
      <p>Uses existing verified accounts (such as government digital ID systems, mobile operator data, or verified social media accounts) to confirm age without requiring the user to submit new documentation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Low friction; leverages existing verification; can be highly accurate</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Not universally available; depends on third-party infrastructure; potential for data sharing concerns</li>
        <li><strong>Used by:</strong> UK Online Safety Act implementations, some European e-commerce platforms, government services</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- SECTION 6: Laws by Country -->

        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>The trend globally is toward stricter age verification requirements. Australia's 2024 decision to ban social media for users under 16 represents the most aggressive approach taken by a Western democracy, and other countries are watching its implementation closely. The UK's Online Safety Act gives regulator Ofcom significant power to require platforms to implement robust age verification, though the specific technical standards are still being finalized.</p>

      <h2>The Future of Age Verification</h2>
      <p>Several emerging technologies and policy trends are likely to reshape age verification in the coming years:</p>

      <h3>Digital Identity Systems</h3>
      <p>Governments worldwide are developing digital identity infrastructure that could streamline age verification. The EU's eIDAS 2.0 regulation will require member states to offer digital identity wallets by 2026, which could include age verification credentials. In the US, mobile driver's licenses (mDLs) are being piloted in several states, allowing age verification without revealing other personal information.</p>

      <h3>Zero-Knowledge Proofs</h3>
      <p>Cryptographic techniques called zero-knowledge proofs allow someone to prove they meet an age threshold without revealing their actual age or other personal data. A user could prove "I am over 18" without disclosing whether they are 19 or 59. Companies like Yoti and various blockchain projects are developing privacy-preserving age verification using these principles.</p>

      <h3>AI-Powered Age Estimation</h3>
      <p>Facial age estimation technology continues to improve. According to industry reports, current systems can estimate age within 2-3 years for most adults and within 1-2 years for children. As accuracy improves, these systems may become standard for content access -- though concerns about bias and privacy persist.</p>

      <h3>Regulatory Convergence</h3>
      <p>As more countries implement strict age verification laws, global platforms may adopt the strictest standard universally rather than maintaining different systems for different jurisdictions. This "Brussels Effect" (named after the EU's tendency to set global standards) could mean that Australian or British age verification requirements become the global norm.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer"><p>The age of 13 comes directly from COPPA. Because COPPA requires parental consent before collecting personal data from children under 13, most platforms simply set 13 as their minimum age to avoid the compliance burden. It is easier to exclude users under 13 entirely than to build and maintain a system for obtaining verifiable parental consent for each young user. This is why you see 13 as the minimum age on virtually every major platform from YouTube to TikTok to Instagram.</p></div>

          <button class="faq-question">What happens if a child lies about their age to sign up for a platform?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>If a child lies about their age using self-declaration, most platforms currently have limited ability to detect this. However, if the platform discovers the user is underage (through reports, content analysis, or other means), it is required to delete the account and all associated data under COPPA. Platforms are increasingly investing in AI-based age estimation tools to detect underage users, but these systems are not perfect. Parents should use parental control tools and have conversations with their children about online safety.</p></div>

          <button class="faq-question">Is COPPA only for US companies?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>COPPA applies to any website or online service that is directed at children in the United States or that has actual knowledge of collecting information from US children under 13, regardless of where the company is based. If a company based in Europe or Asia operates a service that collects data from children in the US, it must comply with COPPA. In practice, because the internet is global, most major platforms comply with COPPA regardless of their headquarters location. Other countries have their own child protection laws (GDPR in the EU, Digital Personal Data Protection Act in India) that may have different age thresholds.</p></div>

          <button class="faq-question">How does facial age estimation work?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>Facial age estimation uses machine learning models trained on millions of faces to predict a person's age from a photo or video. The AI analyzes features like skin texture, wrinkle patterns, facial proportions, and other age-related characteristics. Modern systems can typically estimate age within a margin of 2-3 years for adults and 1-2 years for children and teens. The technology does not identify who the person is -- it only estimates their age. Companies like Yoti and VerifyMyAge provide this as a service to platforms that need age verification.</p></div>

          <button class="faq-question">What age verification do gambling sites use?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>Legitimate gambling sites typically use the most rigorous age verification methods available. In the UK, the Gambling Commission requires operators to verify age before allowing any gambling, using methods like ID document verification, credit reference agency checks, and database matching. In the US, state-regulated online gambling platforms require government ID upload and may cross-reference with public records. Most also use geolocation to ensure the user is in a jurisdiction where online gambling is legal. The age threshold is typically 18 in the UK and most countries, and 21 in many US states.</p></div>

          <button class="faq-question">How can I check my exact age for verification purposes?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>Use our <a href="/">free age calculator</a> to determine your exact age in years, months, and days based on your date of birth. This is useful when you need to know precisely whether you meet an age threshold. For official verification purposes, your birth certificate, passport, or government ID serves as the authoritative source of your date of birth. If there is ever a discrepancy between your actual age and what a platform believes your age to be, contact the platform's support team with official documentation.</p></div>

          <button class="faq-question">What is the difference between age verification and identity verification?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>Age verification confirms that a person meets a minimum age requirement, while identity verification confirms who a person is. Age verification can be done anonymously (e.g., facial age estimation that only determines if someone appears over 18 without identifying them). Identity verification typically requires matching a person to official records (name, address, ID number). Some systems combine both -- verifying identity and extracting age from the ID document simultaneously. The distinction matters for privacy: age verification can preserve anonymity in ways that full identity verification cannot.</p></div>

          <button class="faq-question">Can parents override age restrictions for their children?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>It depends on the platform and jurisdiction. Under COPPA, platforms can allow children under 13 if they obtain verifiable parental consent first -- this is what YouTube Kids and Roblox do, for example. However, some platforms simply prohibit all users under 13 regardless of parental consent. For age-restricted content like gambling or adult material, parental consent typically cannot override legal age requirements. Platforms like Apple's Family Sharing and Google's Family Link allow parents to control app access, but this is parental oversight rather than formal age verification override.</p></div>

          <button class="faq-question">How accurate are AI age estimation tools?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>Modern AI age estimation tools typically achieve accuracy within 2-3 years for most adults. For threshold verification (e.g., determining if someone is over 18), systems can achieve 98%+ accuracy for people who are clearly over or under the threshold. Accuracy decreases for people near the threshold age and can vary by demographic -- some systems have shown bias based on skin tone, gender, or facial features. The UK's Age Verification Providers Association (AVPA) requires certified providers to meet specific accuracy standards. For critical applications, AI estimation is often combined with ID verification for uncertain cases.</p></div>

          <button class="faq-question">What happens to my data after age verification?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>Data retention practices vary significantly by provider and jurisdiction. Under GDPR and similar laws, providers should retain data only as long as necessary and disclose retention periods in their privacy policies. Best-practice providers delete raw images and documents immediately after verification, retaining only the verification result (over/under threshold). Some providers use "data minimization" approaches where only the yes/no result is stored, and no personal data is retained. Always check the provider's privacy policy, and in the EU, you have the right to request deletion under GDPR Article 17.</p></div>
