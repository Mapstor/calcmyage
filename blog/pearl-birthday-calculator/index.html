      <h2 id="what-is-pearl-birthday">What Is a Pearl Birthday?</h2>
      <p>A pearl birthday is the celebration of a person's 75th year of life. Unlike the <a href="/blog/golden-birthday-explained/">golden birthday</a> (which depends on your birth date), the pearl birthday is the same for everyone: it happens when you turn 75, regardless of when in the year you were born.</p>
      <p>The term originates from the long-standing tradition of associating precious materials with milestone anniversaries. In the wedding anniversary system that dates back to the Victorian era, the 75th anniversary is designated the "diamond and gold" anniversary in some traditions and the "pearl" anniversary in others. The pearl birthday borrows from the latter convention.</p>
      <p>Pearls are formed through years of slow, patient growth inside oysters -- a fitting metaphor for the 75 years of accumulated experience, wisdom, and resilience that a pearl birthday represents. Just as natural pearls take decades to develop their full luster, a person reaching 75 has been shaped by three-quarters of a century of living.</p>
      <p>The pearl birthday is part of a broader system of named milestone birthdays that give families and communities special reasons to celebrate the aging process. In an era where <a href="/blog/life-expectancy-calculator/">life expectancy</a> continues to increase in most developed nations, reaching 75 is both a common achievement and a genuinely noteworthy one.</p>

      <h2 id="history-of-pearls">The History and Symbolism of Pearls</h2>
      <p>To understand why 75 is called the "pearl birthday," it helps to know the rich history behind pearls as symbols of wisdom, longevity, and purity. Pearls have been treasured by cultures around the world for thousands of years, and their association with age 75 is deeply rooted in this heritage.</p>

      <h3>Ancient Significance of Pearls</h3>
      <p>Pearls are among the oldest known gemstones, with records of their use dating back to at least 2300 BCE in China. Unlike other gems that must be cut and polished, pearls emerge from the oyster ready to wear, which ancient cultures interpreted as a sign of perfection and divine creation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ancient China:</strong> Pearls symbolized wisdom gained through experience. Legends claimed that pearls were formed in the brains of dragons, connecting them to knowledge and longevity. Chinese royalty were often buried with pearls placed in their mouths.</li>
        <li><strong>Ancient Greece:</strong> Greeks believed pearls were the tears of the gods. They associated pearls with Aphrodite, goddess of love, who according to legend emerged from the sea foam wearing pearl drops.</li>
        <li><strong>Ancient Rome:</strong> Pearls were the ultimate status symbol. Julius Caesar passed a law limiting pearl ownership to the ruling classes. Cleopatra famously dissolved a pearl in vinegar and drank it to win a bet with Marc Antony.</li>
        <li><strong>Ancient Persia:</strong> Pearls represented purity and were believed to have healing properties. Persian physicians prescribed ground pearls for ailments ranging from heart conditions to eye diseases.</li>
        <li><strong>Hindu Tradition:</strong> The Atharvaveda, written around 1000 BCE, mentions pearls as conferring long life, prosperity, and good fortune. Krishna is said to have discovered the first pearl and given it to his daughter on her wedding day.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why Pearls for 75 Years</h3>
      <p>The wedding anniversary tradition of associating materials with specific years began in medieval Germany, where husbands crowned their wives with silver wreaths on the 25th anniversary and gold wreaths on the 50th. This system expanded over centuries, with the <a href="https://www.history.com/articles/wedding-anniversary-gifts-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victorian era</a> adding many more milestones.</p>
      <p>The pearl was assigned to year 75 for symbolic reasons that align with the nature of long-lived relationships:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Formation time:</strong> Natural pearls can take 10-20 years to form, reflecting the patience required for a 75-year journey</li>
        <li><strong>Layer-by-layer growth:</strong> Pearls are built by thousands of thin layers of nacre, just as 75 years of life are built day by day, experience by experience</li>
        <li><strong>Increasing rarity:</strong> Both natural pearls and 75th anniversaries/birthdays are rare achievements</li>
        <li><strong>Beauty through adversity:</strong> Pearls form when an oyster responds to an irritant, transforming difficulty into beauty -- much like the wisdom gained through 75 years of life's challenges</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="how-to-calculate">How to Calculate Your Pearl Birthday</h2>
      <p>Calculating your pearl birthday is straightforward, but if you want to know exactly how many days remain until you turn 75, you will need a more precise calculation. Here is the step-by-step method:</p>

      <h3>Step 1: Determine Your Birth Date</h3>
      <p>You need your exact birth date in the format Month/Day/Year. For example, if you were born on June 15, 1960, that is your starting point.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Add 75 Years</h3>
      <p>Simply add 75 to your birth year. Using our example: 1960 + 75 = 2035. Your pearl birthday would be June 15, 2035.</p>

      <h3>Step 3: Calculate Days Until Pearl Birthday</h3>
      <p>Use our <a href="/#panel-days">age in days calculator</a> to find out exactly how many days you have lived and how many remain until your 75th birthday. The formula is:</p>
      <p><strong>Days until pearl birthday = (Pearl birthday date - Today's date) in days</strong></p>

      <h3>Pearl Birthday Calculation Examples</h3>
      <table class="data-table">

      <h2 id="life-at-75">Life at 75: Statistics and Facts</h2>
      <p>Reaching your pearl birthday is a milestone worth understanding in context. Here are key statistics about life at age 75, drawn from data published by the <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Health Organization</a>, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/life-expectancy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC</a>, and the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Security Administration</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Percentage reaching 75:</strong> In the United States, approximately 60% of people born today can expect to reach age 75, up from about 40% in 1950.</li>
        <li><strong>Remaining life expectancy at 75:</strong> The average 75-year-old in the US can expect to live another 12.5 years (to about 87.5), according to Social Security actuarial data.</li>
        <li><strong>Health status:</strong> About 55% of 75-year-olds report their health as "good" or "excellent," defying the stereotype that this age is defined by decline.</li>
        <li><strong>Living independently:</strong> Roughly 80% of Americans aged 75 still live independently in their own homes or apartments, rather than in assisted-living facilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical activity:</strong> Approximately 35% of people aged 75 and older meet recommended physical activity guidelines, a figure that has been steadily increasing over recent decades.</li>
        <li><strong>Global variation:</strong> In Japan, which leads the world in longevity, about 75% of people reach age 75. In sub-Saharan Africa, that figure drops to approximately 20-30%, highlighting enormous global health inequalities.</li>

      <h2 id="celebration-ideas">Pearl Birthday Celebration Ideas</h2>
      <p>A 75th birthday deserves a celebration that honors the depth and richness of seven and a half decades of life. Here are ideas that go beyond the standard party:</p>

      <h3>Pearl-Themed Dinner Party</h3>
      <p>Lean into the pearl theme with an elegant dinner. Use white and cream-colored tablecloths, scatter faux pearls as table decorations, and serve a multi-course meal featuring the guest of honor's 75 favorite foods (or at least a curated selection). Pearl-colored balloons and candles complete the look.</p>

      <h3>75 Memories Scrapbook</h3>
      <p>Ask 75 people -- friends, family members, colleagues, neighbors -- to each submit one favorite memory, photo, or message about the birthday person. Compile these into a bound scrapbook or digital slideshow. For people who have spent 75 years building relationships, this collection becomes a tangible record of their impact.</p>

      <h3>Decade-by-Decade Timeline</h3>
      <p>Create a visual timeline spanning all 75 years, broken into decades. For each decade, include photos, world events, personal milestones, and pop culture moments. Display it along a wall at the celebration venue. Guests enjoy walking through the timeline and discovering connections to their own lives.</p>

      <h3>75 Acts of Kindness</h3>
      <p>Instead of (or in addition to) gifts, organize a "75 Acts of Kindness" campaign in the birthday person's honor. Family and friends each complete one or more acts of kindness -- volunteering, donating, or helping a neighbor -- and report back. This approach celebrates the values that define a life well-lived.</p>

      <h3>Destination Celebration</h3>
      <p>If health and budget allow, take a trip to a meaningful destination: the place where the birthday person grew up, where they honeymooned, or somewhere on their bucket list. Group travel can be organized for close family, or a smaller intimate trip can be planned for the birthday person and their partner.</p>

      <h2 id="historical-context">Pearl Birthdays in Historical Context</h2>
      <p>The significance of turning 75 has changed dramatically over human history. According to <a href="https://www.history.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">History.com</a> and demographic research from the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIH</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ancient Rome (1st century):</strong> Average life expectancy at birth was roughly 25-35 years (heavily skewed by infant mortality). Reaching 75 was extraordinarily rare -- perhaps 1-2% of those who survived childhood.</li>
        <li><strong>Medieval Europe (1300s):</strong> If you survived childhood, you might live into your 50s or 60s. Reaching 75 placed you among the very oldest people in your community, often viewed with a mixture of respect and superstition.</li>
        <li><strong>Industrial Revolution (1800s):</strong> Life expectancy rose to about 40-50 years. Turning 75 was still exceptional but increasingly possible for the upper classes with access to better nutrition and healthcare.</li>
        <li><strong>Mid-20th century (1950):</strong> US life expectancy reached 68 years. Turning 75 was achievable for roughly 40% of the population, making the pearl birthday a recognized milestone.</li>
        <li><strong>Today (2026):</strong> US life expectancy is approximately 78-79 years. Turning 75 is now a realistic expectation for the majority of people in developed nations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This historical trajectory means that today's pearl birthday celebrants are part of the first generation where reaching 75 is the norm rather than the exception. That fact alone makes it worth celebrating.</p>

          <button class="faq-question">What is a pearl birthday?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none; padding: 1rem; font-size: 0.9375rem; color: var(--gray-700);">A pearl birthday is the celebration of a person's 75th birthday. The name comes from the pearl, which is the traditional gift associated with a 75th wedding anniversary. Just as pearls develop their beauty over many years, the pearl birthday honors a lifetime of experience and growth.</div>

          <button class="faq-question">Why is it called a pearl birthday?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none; padding: 1rem; font-size: 0.9375rem; color: var(--gray-700);">The term "pearl birthday" borrows from the traditional anniversary gift system, where the 75th anniversary is associated with pearls (or diamonds and gold, depending on the tradition). Since natural pearls take many years to form and are considered both beautiful and valuable, the pearl was seen as a fitting symbol for 75 years of life. The symbolism extends to the idea that pearls are created through patience, layer by layer, just like the wisdom accumulated over 75 years.</div>

          <button class="faq-question">How many days old are you at 75?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none; padding: 1rem; font-size: 0.9375rem; color: var(--gray-700);">At age 75, you have been alive for approximately 27,394 days, or about 657,450 hours. The exact number varies slightly depending on how many leap years have occurred since your birth. You can use our <a href="/#panel-days">age in days calculator</a> to find the precise figure based on your specific birth date.</div>

          <button class="faq-question">What percentage of people reach age 75?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none; padding: 1rem; font-size: 0.9375rem; color: var(--gray-700);">In the United States and most developed countries, approximately 60% of people reach age 75. This percentage has been steadily increasing over time due to improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions. In Japan, the percentage is closer to 77%, while in some developing nations, it may be as low as 20-30%.</div>

          <button class="faq-question">What is the difference between a pearl birthday and a diamond birthday?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none; padding: 1rem; font-size: 0.9375rem; color: var(--gray-700);">A pearl birthday celebrates turning 75, while a diamond birthday celebrates turning 60. Both names come from the traditional wedding anniversary gift system. The diamond anniversary is the 60th, and the pearl anniversary is the 75th. Some traditions use "diamond" for the 75th anniversary as well, which can create confusion -- but in the birthday context, pearl consistently refers to 75 and diamond to 60.</div>

          <button class="faq-question">What are good gifts for a 75th pearl birthday?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none; padding: 1rem; font-size: 0.9375rem; color: var(--gray-700);">Pearl jewelry (necklaces, earrings, cufflinks) is the traditional on-theme gift. Other popular 75th birthday gifts include a scrapbook of memories from 75 friends and family, a donation to the person's favorite charity in their name, experience gifts (concert tickets, a special meal, a family trip), or a personalized timeline of their life spanning all 75 years.</div>

          <button class="faq-question">How much longer can a 75-year-old expect to live?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none; padding: 1rem; font-size: 0.9375rem; color: var(--gray-700);">According to the Social Security Administration and WHO data, the average 75-year-old in the US can expect to live another 12.5 years, reaching approximately age 87-88. Women at 75 typically have a slightly longer life expectancy (13.5 years) than men (11.2 years). In Japan, the figure is even higher at 15+ additional years. These are averages -- healthy 75-year-olds often live well into their 90s.</div>

          <button class="faq-question">Is 75 considered old?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none; padding: 1rem; font-size: 0.9375rem; color: var(--gray-700);">The perception of 75 as "old" has shifted dramatically. In the 1950s, 75 was well beyond life expectancy and clearly "old age." Today, with life expectancy approaching 80 and many people active well into their 80s and 90s, 75 is increasingly viewed as the start of a later chapter rather than the end. Research shows that 55% of 75-year-olds report their health as "good" or "excellent," and 80% still live independently.</div>

          <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none; padding: 1rem; font-size: 0.9375rem; color: var(--gray-700);">A <a href="/blog/golden-birthday-explained/">golden birthday</a> occurs when your age matches your birth date -- for example, turning 15 on the 15th of the month. This happens only once per person and at a different age for everyone. A pearl birthday is specifically turning 75 years old, regardless of birth date. The golden birthday is based on the day of the month you were born, while the pearl birthday is a fixed milestone at age 75.</div>

          <button class="faq-question">What milestone birthday comes after the pearl birthday?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none; padding: 1rem; font-size: 0.9375rem; color: var(--gray-700);">After the pearl birthday (75), the next major named milestone is typically the 80th birthday, sometimes called the "oak birthday" (referencing the strength and longevity of oak trees). Then comes the 90th birthday, and finally the centennial at 100. In some traditions, the 85th birthday is also recognized. See our <a href="/blog/age-milestones/">age milestones guide</a> for a complete list of named birthdays.</div>
