      <!-- ===== HOW TO CALCULATE ===== -->
      <h2 id="how-to-calculate">How to Calculate Your Age in Weeks</h2>
      <p>Calculating your age in weeks is straightforward once you understand the relationship between years, days, and weeks. The key number to remember is that one year averages <strong>365.25 days</strong> (accounting for leap years that occur every four years). Since one week contains exactly 7 days, one year equals approximately <strong>52.1775 weeks</strong>.</p>

      <h3>The Basic Formula</h3>
      <p>The simplest approach uses this formula:</p>
      <div style="background: var(--gray-50); border: 1px solid var(--gray-200); border-radius: var(--radius-md); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; text-align: center;">
        <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 0;">Age in Weeks = (Years x 52.1775) + Extra Weeks</p>
      </div>
      <p>The "extra weeks" accounts for any additional days beyond your last full year. For example, if you are 30 years and 45 days old, you would calculate: (30 x 52.1775) + (45 / 7) = 1,565.33 + 6.43 = <strong>1,571.76 weeks</strong>, or approximately 1,571 completed weeks.</p>

      <h3>Step-by-Step Calculation Method</h3>
      <p>For the most precise result, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Count total days alive.</strong> Calculate the exact number of days from your birth date to today. Remember to account for leap years (years divisible by 4, except century years not divisible by 400). You can use our <a href="/blog/age-in-days-calculator/">age in days calculator</a> for this step.</li>
        <li><strong>Divide by 7.</strong> Take your total days alive and divide by 7. The whole number is your completed weeks; the remainder is your extra days into the current week.</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Someone born on March 15, 1994 has lived approximately 11,649 days as of February 5, 2026. Dividing 11,649 by 7 gives <strong>1,664 weeks</strong> and 1 day.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Of course, the fastest way is to use our <a href="/">age calculator</a>, which computes your exact age in weeks automatically, accounting for every leap year and calendar variation.</p>

      <h3>Why 52.1775 and Not 52?</h3>
      <p>Many people assume there are exactly 52 weeks in a year, but that only accounts for 364 days (52 x 7). A standard year has 365 days, meaning there is always 1 extra day. In a leap year, there are 2 extra days. Over the 400-year Gregorian calendar cycle, the average year length is exactly 365.2425 days, giving us 365.2425 / 7 = 52.1775 weeks per year. This fractional difference adds up significantly over a lifetime -- by age 80, it accounts for more than 14 extra weeks.</p>

      <h3>Leap Year Considerations</h3>
      <p>Leap years add complexity to week calculations. The Gregorian calendar, established in 1582 and documented by <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/gregorian-calendar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">timeanddate.com</a>, follows these rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Years divisible by 4 are leap years (366 days)</li>
        <li>Exception: Years divisible by 100 are NOT leap years</li>
        <li>Exception to the exception: Years divisible by 400 ARE leap years</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So 2024 was a leap year, 2100 will not be, but 2000 was. This means the number of weeks in different years varies slightly, which is why our calculator counts actual days rather than estimating.</p>

      <!-- ===== HISTORY OF SEVEN-DAY WEEK ===== -->
      <h2 id="history-seven-day">The History of the Seven-Day Week</h2>
      <p>The seven-day week is one of humanity's most enduring inventions, spanning nearly all cultures and civilizations for over 4,000 years. Unlike months (based on lunar cycles) or years (based on Earth's orbit), the week has no astronomical basis -- it is purely a human creation that has nonetheless become universal.</p>

      <h3>Ancient Origins</h3>
      <p>The seven-day week originated in ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) around 2000 BCE. The Babylonians, who were sophisticated astronomers, noticed seven celestial bodies visible to the naked eye that moved against the fixed background of stars:</p>
      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Celestial Body</th><th>Babylonian God</th><th>Roman God</th><th>English Day Name</th><th>Origin</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Sun</td><td>Shamash</td><td>Sol</td><td>Sunday</td><td>Sun's Day</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Moon</td><td>Sin</td><td>Luna</td><td>Monday</td><td>Moon's Day</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Mars</td><td>Nergal</td><td>Mars</td><td>Tuesday</td><td>Tiw's Day (Norse god)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Mercury</td><td>Nabu</td><td>Mercury</td><td>Wednesday</td><td>Woden's Day (Odin)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Jupiter</td><td>Marduk</td><td>Jupiter</td><td>Thursday</td><td>Thor's Day</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Venus</td><td>Ishtar</td><td>Venus</td><td>Friday</td><td>Frigg's Day</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Saturn</td><td>Ninurta</td><td>Saturn</td><td>Saturday</td><td>Saturn's Day</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>The Babylonians assigned each day to one of these celestial bodies, creating a cycle that repeated every seven days. This system spread to the ancient Jews (who adopted it during their Babylonian exile around 600 BCE), then to Greeks, Romans, and eventually to the entire world through Roman conquest and later Christian and Islamic expansion.</p>

      <h3>Alternatives That Failed</h3>
      <p>Throughout history, various cultures have tried different week lengths, but none have succeeded in replacing the seven-day week:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ancient Romans:</strong> Used an 8-day market week (nundinae) alongside the 7-day week until the 7-day week won out around 321 CE when Emperor Constantine made Sunday an official day of rest</li>
        <li><strong>Ancient Egyptians:</strong> Used a 10-day week (decan), with three decans per month</li>
        <li><strong>French Revolutionary Calendar (1793-1805):</strong> Attempted a 10-day week called a "decade" to decimalize time. It was deeply unpopular and abandoned by Napoleon</li>
        <li><strong>Soviet Union (1929-1940):</strong> Tried both 5-day and 6-day weeks to increase industrial productivity. Workers hated losing their synchronized rest day with family and friends</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to research documented by <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/history-of-the-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">History.com</a>, the seven-day week has proven remarkably resilient because it creates a shared rhythm of work and rest that enables social coordination.</p>

      <h3>The ISO Week Standard</h3>
      <p>Today, the international standard for weeks is defined by ISO 8601. According to this standard:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Weeks begin on Monday (not Sunday)</li>
        <li>The first week of the year is the one containing the first Thursday of January</li>
        <li>Years can have either 52 or 53 weeks</li>
        <li>Weeks are numbered from W01 to W52 (or W53)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This standardization is important for international business, project management, and computing, ensuring that "Week 12" means the same thing worldwide.</p>

      <!-- ===== PREGNANCY AND WEEKS ===== -->
      <h2 id="pregnancy-weeks">Pregnancy and Weeks: Why Weeks Are the Standard Unit</h2>
      <p>If there is one area of life where weeks are the dominant unit of measurement, it is pregnancy. Doctors, midwives, and expectant parents universally track pregnancy in weeks rather than months. A full-term pregnancy is <strong>40 weeks</strong> (280 days), counted from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP), even though conception typically occurs around week 2.</p>

      <h3>The Three Trimesters</h3>
      <table class="data-table">
        <thead><tr><th>Trimester</th><th>Week Range</th><th>Key Developments</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>

      <h3>Critical Pregnancy Week Milestones</h3>
      <p>Medical professionals use specific week thresholds to assess pregnancy progress and risk:</p>

            <tr><td><strong>Week 12</strong></td><td>End of first trimester; miscarriage risk drops significantly</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Week 20</strong></td><td>Anatomy scan performed; halfway point of pregnancy</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Week 24</strong></td><td>Viability threshold - survival outside womb becomes possible with intensive care</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Week 28</strong></td><td>Survival rate exceeds 90% if born; lung development accelerates</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Week 34</strong></td><td>"Late preterm" - most babies do well with minimal intervention</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Week 37</strong></td><td>"Early term" - delivery no longer considered preterm</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Week 39-40</strong></td><td>"Full term" - optimal time for birth per <a href="https://www.acog.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACOG</a> guidelines</td></tr>

          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h3>Why Weeks Instead of Months?</h3>
      <p>Calendar months vary from 28 to 31 days, making them imprecise for medical tracking. Weeks provide a consistent 7-day unit that allows doctors to precisely monitor fetal development, schedule critical tests (like the anatomy scan at week 20 or the glucose test at weeks 24-28), and assess risk windows. Preterm birth, for instance, is defined as delivery before 37 weeks -- a level of precision that monthly counting cannot provide. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC's National Vital Statistics System</a> reports all birth statistics using gestational weeks.</p>
      <p>If you are tracking a pregnancy, you might also find our <a href="/blog/age-in-days-calculator/">age in days calculator</a> useful for counting exact days from conception or from the due date.</p>

      <!-- ===== LIFE IN WEEKS ===== -->
      <h2 id="life-in-weeks">Your Life in Weeks: The Philosophy of Finite Time</h2>
      <p>In 2014, writer Tim Urban published a blog post on <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wait But Why</a> called "Your Life in Weeks" that went viral and changed how millions of people think about time. The core idea is simple but profound: if you live to 90, your entire life can be represented as a grid of about 4,680 small squares on a single sheet of paper, where each square represents one week.</p>

      <h3>What Makes This Visualization So Powerful</h3>
      <p>When you see your life as a grid of weeks, several things become immediately apparent:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Childhood feels long but is short.</strong> The first 18 years (936 weeks) represent only about 20% of your total weeks if you live to 90.</li>
        <li><strong>Decades pass quickly.</strong> Each decade is only about 522 squares -- a small cluster in the overall grid.</li>
        <li><strong>Remaining weeks are visible.</strong> If you shade in the weeks you have already lived, the blank weeks remaining become starkly visible, creating a powerful sense of urgency.</li>
        <li><strong>Major events are pinpoints.</strong> Your wedding, the birth of a child, a career change -- each occupies just one or two squares out of thousands.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Four Thousand Weeks: The Book</h3>
      <p>Oliver Burkeman's bestselling book <em>Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals</em> (2021) takes its title from the approximate number of weeks in an 80-year life. The book, which became a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/books/review/four-thousand-weeks-oliver-burkeman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times bestseller</a>, argues that accepting our finite number of weeks -- rather than trying to "optimize" every moment -- is the key to a meaningful life. Key insights include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>You will never "get everything done."</strong> The to-do list is infinite; your weeks are not.</li>
        <li><strong>Productivity culture is a trap.</strong> Doing more just leads to more being expected of you.</li>
        <li><strong>Embrace limitation.</strong> Saying "no" to most things allows you to say "yes" meaningfully to a few.</li>
        <li><strong>Time is your life.</strong> How you spend your weeks is how you spend your existence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Weeks Lived vs. Weeks Remaining</h3>
      <p>The chart below compares weeks already lived to estimated remaining weeks (based on the US average life expectancy of approximately 79 years, or 4,122 weeks).

        <li><strong>Pregnancy tracking:</strong> As discussed above, expectant parents track pregnancy week by week for medical precision</li>
        <li><strong>Infant development:</strong> Pediatricians assess babies' development in weeks for the first few months of life</li>
        <li><strong>Neonatal intensive care:</strong> Premature babies are tracked by gestational weeks, with survival rates published by week</li>
        <li><strong>Pediatric studies:</strong> Research on child development often uses weeks for precise age categorization</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Professional and Planning Contexts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Project management:</strong> Scrum sprints (typically 1-2 weeks) use weeks as the fundamental planning unit</li>
        <li><strong>Academic scheduling:</strong> School semesters are typically measured in weeks (15-16 weeks for a standard semester)</li>
        <li><strong>Fiscal planning:</strong> Many businesses plan budgets on a weekly basis</li>
        <li><strong>Deadline tracking:</strong> "T-minus 12 weeks" is more actionable than "about 3 months"</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Personal Development</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Habit tracking:</strong> The popular "don't break the chain" method tracks consecutive weeks of maintaining a habit</li>
        <li><strong>Goal setting:</strong> 12-week year programs structure major goals into 12-week sprints</li>
        <li><strong>Life review:</strong> Weekly journaling creates 52 reflection points per year vs. 12 monthly entries</li>

On average, accounting for the leap year cycle, one year contains approximately 52.1775 weeks (365.25 / 7). So while we commonly say 52 weeks, the precise average is slightly more.</p>

            <p>Weeks provide more precision than months for medical tracking. Calendar months vary from 28 to 31 days, which creates ambiguity. A week is always exactly 7 days, allowing doctors to precisely schedule tests, track fetal development, and identify risk windows. The medical community uses weeks because fetal development follows a predictable week-by-week timeline, and conditions like preterm birth are defined by specific week thresholds (before 37 weeks).</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The "4,000 weeks" concept comes from the observation that the average human lifespan of about 80 years equals roughly 4,000 weeks. This idea was popularized by Oliver Burkeman's 2021 book "Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals" and by Tim Urban's "Your Life in Weeks" blog post on <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wait But Why</a>. The concept is used to illustrate the finite nature of human life and encourage intentional living.</p>

            <p>Yes. Our <a href="/">age calculator</a> counts the exact number of days between your birth date and today, including every leap year that occurred during your lifetime. This means your weeks calculation is precise to the day, not an estimate based on averages. The conversion table on this page uses the average of 365.25 days per year for simplicity, but the calculator gives you the exact number.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The seven-day week originated in ancient Babylon around 2000 BCE, based on the seven celestial bodies visible to the naked eye: the Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. Each day was dedicated to one of these bodies. The system spread through the ancient world via trade, conquest, and religion (both Judaism and Christianity adopted the seven-day week), eventually becoming universal. Unlike months and years, the week has no astronomical basis -- it is purely a human invention.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>An ISO week follows the ISO 8601 international standard. ISO weeks always start on Monday, and the first week of the year (W01) is defined as the week containing the first Thursday of January. This means a year can have either 52 or 53 ISO weeks. The standard ensures that "Week 12" means the same dates worldwide, which is important for international business and computing.</p>
