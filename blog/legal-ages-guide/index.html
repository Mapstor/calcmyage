      <!-- SECTION 1: US Legal Ages -->
      <h2 id="us-legal-ages">Legal Ages in the United States</h2>
      <p>The United States assigns a patchwork of age-based rights and responsibilities. Unlike many countries that cluster most legal thresholds around age 18, the US spreads them from as early as 14 (working with restrictions in some states) to 67 (full Social Security benefits for those born in 1960 or later). Understanding these milestones helps you plan important life events and know your legal standing at every age.</p>

      <p>The table below summarizes the major federal and common state-level age thresholds in the United States. Note that some of these vary by state -- particularly driving and marriage ages -- so always check your specific state's laws for exact requirements.</p>

      <table class="data-table">
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Milestone</th><th>Age</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
        </thead>

          <tr><td>Full Social Security retirement</td><td>66-67</td><td>67 for anyone born 1960 or later</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>Several of these thresholds have changed over time. The voting age dropped from 21 to 18 in 1971 via the 26th Amendment, largely driven by the argument that 18-year-olds drafted to fight in Vietnam should have the right to vote. The tobacco purchasing age was raised from 18 to 21 nationwide in December 2019 as part of a federal appropriations bill. The drinking age was effectively standardized at 21 in 1984 when the federal government threatened to withhold highway funding from states that set it lower.</p>

      <h2>The History of Legal Age Requirements</h2>
      <p>Legal age thresholds have evolved dramatically throughout history, reflecting changing views on childhood, adulthood, and societal responsibility.</p>

      <h3>Ancient and Medieval Periods</h3>
      <p>In ancient Rome, the age of majority for boys was 14 (puberty) and 12 for girls. These ages permitted marriage and some legal transactions. Medieval Europe continued these traditions, with 14/12 remaining the canonical ages for marriage consent in Catholic Church law until modern times.</p>

      <h3>18th-19th Century Reforms</h3>
      <p>The concept of "age 21 as adulthood" comes from medieval English common law, where 21 was the age at which a young man could wear armor and fight. This became the voting age in the American colonies and remained so until 1971. The 21-year threshold also governed property ownership, contract signing, and other adult rights.</p>

      <h3>20th Century Changes</h3>
      <p>The modern trend toward lowering the age of majority to 18 began after World War II. If young men could be drafted to fight and die at 18, the argument went, they should be able to vote. This logic spread globally, with most countries adopting 18 as the age of majority by the 1970s.</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Era</th><th>Common Age of Majority</th><th>Key Events</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Ancient Rome</td><td>14 (boys), 12 (girls)</td><td>Puberty-based adulthood</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Medieval England</td><td>21</td><td>Armor-bearing age</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Colonial America</td><td>21</td><td>Inherited from English law</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Post-WWII</td><td>18-21</td><td>Draft age debate begins</td></tr>
            <tr><td>1970s-present</td><td>18</td><td>26th Amendment (US, 1971)</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h2>Age of Majority vs. Age of License</h2>
      <p>It is important to distinguish between the <strong>age of majority</strong> (when you become a legal adult) and various <strong>ages of license</strong> (when you can do specific things). In the US, these often do not align:</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Concept</th><th>US Age</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td><strong>Age of Majority</strong></td><td>18</td><td>Legal adulthood; can sign contracts, vote, marry without consent</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Age of License (Driving)</strong></td><td>16</td><td>Can operate a motor vehicle (varies by state)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Age of License (Alcohol)</strong></td><td>21</td><td>Can purchase and consume alcohol</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Age of License (Tobacco)</strong></td><td>21</td><td>Can purchase tobacco products</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Age of Consent</strong></td><td>16-18</td><td>Can consent to sexual activity (varies by state)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Age of Criminal Responsibility</strong></td><td>6-12</td><td>Can be prosecuted for crimes (varies by state)</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION 2: Drinking Ages -->
      <h2 id="drinking-ages">Legal Drinking Ages Around the World</h2>
      <p>The legal drinking age is one of the most discussed and debated age thresholds globally. While the United States famously sets it at 21, the vast majority of nations allow alcohol purchase and consumption at 18 or younger. Some countries have no minimum drinking age at all, while others prohibit alcohol entirely regardless of age.</p>

      <p>The variation reflects differing cultural attitudes toward alcohol. In wine-producing regions of Europe, moderate consumption by teenagers is often considered part of family life, and the legal framework reflects this. In contrast, the US approach emphasizes the link between younger drinking and traffic fatalities -- a connection that drove the passage of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act.</p>

      <p>A few patterns emerge from this data. First, 18 is by far the most common legal drinking age worldwide. Second, several European countries differentiate between low-alcohol beverages (beer, wine) and spirits, allowing purchase of the former at 16. Third, countries with strong Islamic traditions often prohibit alcohol entirely, regardless of age. And fourth, the US stands nearly alone among Western nations in setting the threshold at 21.</p>

      <p>Research published by the <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/alcohol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> shows that higher minimum drinking ages are associated with lower rates of alcohol-related traffic fatalities among young people. However, critics argue that setting the age too high simply pushes consumption underground, where it is harder to supervise and more dangerous.</p>

      <p>The United States is notable for its relatively low driving ages, a consequence of the country's vast geography and limited public transportation in rural areas. In contrast, countries with robust train and bus networks (such as Japan, the Netherlands, and Germany) tend to set the driving age higher and emphasize rigorous testing before granting a license.</p>

      <p>Many countries have adopted <strong>graduated driver licensing (GDL)</strong> systems, which phase in driving privileges over several months or years. These systems typically include a supervised learning period, a restricted intermediate period (e.g., no nighttime driving or teen passengers), and finally a full unrestricted license. Research from the <a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/teenagers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS)</a> shows that GDL programs reduce crash rates among new drivers by 20-40%.</p>

      <p>The global trend is clearly moving toward lower voting ages. Since 2007, when Austria became the first EU member state to lower its national voting age to 16, at least a dozen other jurisdictions have followed suit in some form. Advocates point to research suggesting that 16-year-olds who vote are more likely to develop a lifelong voting habit compared to those who first become eligible at 18, when many are in the middle of relocating for college or work.</p>

      <p>A major trend in recent years has been the elimination of marriage exceptions for minors. England and Wales raised the minimum marriage age to 18 with no exceptions in 2023, joining countries like the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany that had already closed similar loopholes. The United States is still a patchwork: while most states set 18 as the standard, at least a few still allow marriages as young as 16 with parental consent, and some previously had no minimum age at all when judicial approval was granted.</p>

      <h3>Child Marriage: A Global Issue</h3>
      <p>Despite legal minimum ages, child marriage (under 18) remains prevalent in many parts of the world. According to <a href="https://www.unicef.org/protection/child-marriage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNICEF</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Globally, 650 million women alive today were married before age 18</li>
        <li>12 million girls are married each year before reaching 18</li>
        <li>The highest rates are in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia</li>
        <li>Poverty, lack of education, and gender inequality are primary drivers</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>US States That Have Banned Child Marriage Entirely</h3>
      <p>As of 2026, the following US states have set 18 as the minimum marriage age with no exceptions:</p>

      <!-- SECTION 6: Why Ages Differ -->
      <h2 id="why-differ">Why Legal Ages Differ Between Countries</h2>
      <p>Understanding why countries set different legal ages requires looking at several intersecting factors:</p>

      <h3>Brain Development Research</h3>
      <p>Modern neuroscience has shown that the prefrontal cortex -- the brain region responsible for decision-making, impulse control, and risk assessment -- does not fully mature until roughly age 25. This research has been used to justify higher age thresholds for activities like drinking and driving, where impaired judgment can have fatal consequences. The American Academy of Pediatrics and many public health organizations cite this research when advocating for maintaining higher age limits.</p>

      <h3>Cultural and Religious Values</h3>
      <p>In many societies, cultural traditions play a larger role than scientific evidence in setting legal ages. Countries with strong traditions of family wine consumption (France, Italy) historically had lower drinking ages. Nations influenced by Islamic law often prohibit alcohol entirely. Marriage ages in some regions reflect longstanding cultural practices around family formation, though international human rights organizations are increasingly challenging these traditions when they affect minors.</p>

      <h3>Historical Precedent and Political Pressure</h3>
      <p>Many age thresholds were set decades or even centuries ago and have been modified only when significant political pressure arose. The US voting age dropped to 18 in 1971 largely because of the Vietnam War draft. The drinking age rose to 21 in 1984 after Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) waged a successful national campaign. These changes demonstrate that legal ages are not fixed -- they evolve as societies and their priorities change.</p>

      <h3>Infrastructure and Geography</h3>
      <p>Countries with vast rural areas and limited public transportation (like the United States and Australia) tend to grant driving privileges earlier because driving is a practical necessity. In contrast, countries with extensive public transit systems (Japan, Netherlands, many urban European nations) can afford to set higher driving ages because young people have viable alternatives for getting around.</p>

      <h3>Economic Considerations</h3>
      <p>The age at which young people can work, sign contracts, and participate in the economy is often tied to broader economic policies. Countries with strong social safety nets and extended educational systems tend to set higher thresholds for economic independence, while those where young people need to contribute to family income earlier may set lower working ages. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/age_of_majority" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cornell Law Institute</a> provides detailed analysis of how the age of majority interacts with contract law and economic rights in the United States.</p>

      <h2>Age of Criminal Responsibility</h2>
      <p>The age at which a person can be held legally accountable for crimes varies dramatically worldwide. This threshold reflects beliefs about when children can understand right from wrong and the consequences of their actions.</p>

      <p>New legislation in various countries (including the UK's Online Safety Bill and various US state laws) is pushing for more robust age verification for adult content, potentially requiring government ID or biometric verification rather than simple self-declaration.</p>

      <h2>Working Age Requirements</h2>
      <p>Child labor laws protect young people while allowing age-appropriate work opportunities. The <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/child-labor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Department of Labor</a> sets federal standards:</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Age</th><th>Work Allowed</th><th>Hours Restrictions</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td><strong>Under 14</strong></td><td>Babysitting, acting, newspaper delivery (limited)</td><td>No formal work</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>14-15</strong></td><td>Retail, food service (non-hazardous)</td><td>3 hrs/school day, 8 hrs/non-school, 18 hrs/week during school</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>16-17</strong></td><td>Any non-hazardous job</td><td>Unlimited hours, but school mandatory</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>18+</strong></td><td>Any job including hazardous</td><td>No restrictions</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h3>Hazardous Occupation Restrictions</h3>
      <p>Workers under 18 cannot be employed in certain dangerous occupations including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manufacturing or storing explosives</li>
        <li>Mining and coal excavation</li>
        <li>Operating power-driven machinery (meat slicers, bakery machines, paper balers)</li>
        <li>Logging and sawmill operations</li>
        <li>Roofing and excavation work</li>
        <li>Driving vehicles or operating forklifts</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Age and Contract Law</h2>
      <p>The ability to enter into legally binding contracts is a fundamental aspect of adulthood. Here is how age affects contractual capacity:</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Contract Type</th><th>Minor (Under 18)</th><th>Adult (18+)</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>General contracts</td><td>Voidable by minor</td><td>Fully binding</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Necessities (food, clothing, shelter)</td><td>Binding</td><td>Binding</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Employment contracts</td><td>Generally binding</td><td>Binding</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Military enlistment</td><td>Binding at 17 w/parent</td><td>Binding at 18</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Marriage contract</td><td>Varies by state (16-18)</td><td>Binding</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Cell phone contracts</td><td>Voidable</td><td>Binding</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Apartment leases</td><td>Voidable</td><td>Binding</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>The "voidable" nature of minor contracts means the minor can choose to cancel them, but the adult party cannot. This protects young people from predatory practices while still allowing them to engage in commerce for necessities.</p>

      <h2>Gambling Age Requirements</h2>
      <p>Gambling ages vary by jurisdiction and type of gambling:</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Gambling Type</th><th>Minimum Age (US)</th><th>International Comparison</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Casinos</td><td>21 (most states)</td><td>18-21 varies</td></tr>
            <tr><td>State lottery</td><td>18 (most states)</td><td>16-18 (UK allows 16)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Sports betting</td><td>21 (most states)</td><td>18 (most countries)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Horse racing</td><td>18 (most states)</td><td>16-18</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Bingo</td><td>18 (most states)</td><td>No minimum (UK)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Daily fantasy sports</td><td>18-21 (varies)</td><td>18 typical</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>Note that some US states (like California and Hawaii) do not have commercial casinos, so casino gambling ages are moot there. Tribal casinos may set their own age limits, typically 18 or 21.</p>

      <h2>Age Requirements for Adoption</h2>
      <p>Adoption laws include age requirements for both prospective parents and children:</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Requirement</th><th>US (varies by state)</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>

          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h2>Medical Consent Ages</h2>
      <p>The age at which young people can make their own medical decisions varies by type of care and jurisdiction:</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Medical Situation</th><th>Age of Consent (US)</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>General medical care</td><td>18</td><td>Parental consent required under 18</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Emergency treatment</td><td>Any age</td><td>Implied consent in emergencies</td></tr>
            <tr><td>STI testing/treatment</td><td>12-18 (varies)</td><td>Most states allow minors</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Contraception</td><td>Any age (many states)</td><td>Title X funding rules</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Abortion</td><td>Varies widely</td><td>Parental notification in some states</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Mental health treatment</td><td>12-16 (varies)</td><td>Outpatient often 12-14</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Substance abuse treatment</td><td>12 (many states)</td><td>Confidential access encouraged</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Blood donation</td><td>16-17 w/consent, 18+</td><td>Varies by blood bank policy</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>The "mature minor doctrine" allows some courts to recognize a minor's capacity to consent to medical treatment based on their demonstrated maturity, regardless of age. This is applied on a case-by-case basis.</p>

      <h2>Firearm Purchase Ages</h2>
      <p>Gun purchase and ownership ages in the United States vary by weapon type:</p>

      <div class="chart-bar-group">
        <div class="chart-bar-item"><span class="chart-bar-label">Handguns (licensed dealer)</span><div class="chart-bar-track"><div class="chart-bar-fill accent" style="width:100%">21 years old</div></div></div>

      </div>
      <p>Some states have raised their own minimum ages above federal requirements. Florida, for example, raised the minimum age for all firearms purchases to 21 after the Parkland shooting in 2018. For comparison, most European countries require age 18 for firearms, with extensive licensing requirements.</p>

      <h2>Age of Consent: A Global Comparison</h2>
      <p>The age of sexual consent varies significantly worldwide and remains one of the most debated age thresholds. Note that these are legal minimums; other factors like relationship power dynamics and specific circumstances also affect legality.</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Age</th><th>Countries/Regions</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>

          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>Many countries have "Romeo and Juliet" or "close-in-age" exemptions that allow sexual activity between teenagers close in age even when one is below the general age of consent. In the US, these vary widely by state.</p>

      <h2>School Enrollment Ages Worldwide</h2>
      <p>The age at which children start formal schooling varies by country:</p>

      <p style="font-size: 0.8125rem; color: var(--gray-500); text-align: center;">Finland's later start age has not prevented it from having one of the world's top education systems.</p>

      <h2>Retirement Ages Around the World</h2>

      <h2>Age Discrimination Laws</h2>
      <p>While minimum ages restrict younger people, maximum ages or age discrimination can affect older individuals. Key protections include:</p>

      <h3>United States</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA):</strong> Protects workers 40+ from employment discrimination</li>
        <li><strong>No mandatory retirement:</strong> Except for specific occupations (pilots at 65, some law enforcement)</li>
        <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Fair Housing Act prohibits age discrimination (with senior housing exceptions)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>European Union</h3>
      <p>The EU Employment Equality Directive prohibits age discrimination in employment across all member states. However, exceptions exist for occupational requirements and positive action measures.</p>

      <h2>Emancipation of Minors</h2>
      <p>Emancipation is the legal process by which a minor gains adult status before reaching the age of majority. This grants the minor the right to enter contracts, make medical decisions, and live independently of parents.</p>

      <h2>How Legal Ages Are Changing</h2>
      <p>Legal ages are not static. Recent trends include:</p>

      <h3>Ages Moving Higher</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Tobacco purchase age raised to 21 (US, 2019)</li>
        <li>Marriage ages raised to 18 without exception (several US states, UK)</li>
        <li>Retirement ages increasing in most developed countries</li>

      <h3>Future Predictions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>More countries likely to consider voting at 16</li>
        <li>Continued upward pressure on retirement ages</li>
        <li>Stricter age verification for online services and purchases</li>
        <li>Possible harmonization of legal ages within regional blocs (EU, etc.)</li>

      <p>As noted in our <a href="/blog/korean-age-calculator/">Korean age</a> and <a href="/blog/lunar-age-calculator/">lunar age</a> guides, not all countries count age the same way:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Western system:</strong> Age 0 at birth, +1 on each birthday</li>
        <li><strong>Korean traditional:</strong> Age 1 at birth, +1 on January 1</li>
        <li><strong>Chinese traditional:</strong> Age 1 at birth, +1 at Lunar New Year</li>
        <li><strong>Legal systems:</strong> Almost all use Western age for legal purposes</li>

      <p>This visual makes clear that Americans experience a particularly drawn-out transition into full legal adulthood. While most rights arrive between 16 and 21, significant milestones like eligibility for the presidency (35) and retirement benefits (62-67) extend far beyond what most people think of as "coming of age."</p>

      <!-- SECTION 8: FAQ -->
      <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-list">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">What country has the lowest legal drinking age?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>Several countries have no minimum drinking age at all, including some African and Caribbean nations where alcohol laws are either absent or not enforced. Among countries with a defined legal age, Belgium, Germany, Austria, and Denmark allow the purchase of beer and wine at 16, making them among the lowest in the world for regulated markets.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">Why is the US drinking age 21 instead of 18?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>The National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 required all states to set their drinking age at 21 or face a reduction in federal highway funding. This law was driven by research showing that when states had lower drinking ages in the 1970s, traffic fatalities among young drivers increased significantly. The Supreme Court upheld the law in South Dakota v. Dole (1987), ruling that Congress could use its spending power to incentivize states in this way.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">Can a 16-year-old vote anywhere in the world?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. Austria allows voting at 16 for all elections. Scotland and Wales allow it for devolved elections. Brazil, Ecuador, Argentina, Cuba, and several other nations also permit 16-year-olds to vote, though in some cases voting is optional at 16 and becomes compulsory at 18. Malta lowered its voting age to 16 in 2018.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">What is the youngest driving age in the world?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>Some US states allow learner's permits as young as 14 (South Dakota, for example). However, these permits require a licensed adult in the vehicle. For unsupervised driving, the youngest common age is 16 in the United States and some parts of Canada. Most countries require drivers to be at least 17 or 18 for any form of driving.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">At what age is a person legally an adult worldwide?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>The age of majority -- the age at which a person is legally considered an adult -- is 18 in the vast majority of countries. Notable exceptions include the United States (where some states still consider 19 or 21 for certain purposes), South Korea (19), Japan (18 since 2022, previously 20), Singapore (21), and some countries where marriage confers adult status regardless of age.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">Why do some countries set different ages for beer versus spirits?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>Countries like Germany, Austria, Belgium, and Denmark allow the purchase of lower-alcohol beverages (beer and wine) at 16 while requiring customers to be 18 for spirits. The rationale is that lower-alcohol drinks carry less immediate risk of intoxication and are traditionally consumed with meals as part of family culture. Spirits, with their higher alcohol content, are considered more dangerous for younger people and are therefore restricted to a higher age threshold.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">What is the legal age to get married in the US?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>In most US states, the standard marriage age is 18 without parental consent. Many states allow marriage at 16 or 17 with parental consent. A few states have recently raised their minimum marriage age to 18 with no exceptions (Delaware was the first in 2016, followed by New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and others). The laws vary significantly by state, so check your specific state's requirements.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">How do I calculate my exact age for legal purposes?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>For legal purposes, your age is typically calculated based on your date of birth as listed on your birth certificate or passport. You are considered to have reached a given age on your birthday, not the day before. Use our <a href="/">free age calculator</a> to determine your exact age in years, months, and days. For specific legal contexts (such as eligibility for benefits), the relevant agency or authority may have its own precise method for counting age.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">At what age can you sign a legal contract?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>In most countries, the age to sign a binding contract is the age of majority, typically 18. Before this age, contracts signed by minors are generally voidable, meaning the minor can choose to cancel them. Exceptions exist for contracts for necessities (food, clothing, housing) and in some cases employment contracts. Some jurisdictions allow minors to sign certain contracts with parental consent.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">What is the youngest age you can get a tattoo?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>Tattoo age requirements vary by jurisdiction. In most US states, you must be 18 to get a tattoo without parental consent. Some states allow tattooing at 16 or 17 with parental consent and presence. A few states have no minimum age with parental consent. In the UK, it is illegal to tattoo anyone under 18 regardless of parental consent. Many European countries follow similar rules.</p></div>

      <h2>Celebrity Legal Age Milestones</h2>
      <p>Famous individuals often illustrate how legal ages play out in real life:</p>

        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Celebrity</th><th>Age-Related Event</th><th>Age</th><th>Context</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td><strong>Greta Thunberg</strong></td><td>Began climate activism</td><td>15</td><td>Below voting age but changed global policy</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Malala Yousafzai</strong></td><td>Shot by Taliban</td><td>15</td><td>Nobel Prize at 17 (youngest laureate)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong></td><td>Elected to Congress</td><td>29</td><td>Youngest woman elected (must be 25)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Pete Buttigieg</strong></td><td>Presidential candidate</td><td>37</td><td>Just above constitutional minimum of 35</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Barack Obama</strong></td><td>Elected President</td><td>47</td><td>One of the younger presidents</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Joe Biden</strong></td><td>Elected President</td><td>78</td><td>Oldest person elected (no maximum age)</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>These examples show that age requirements can both enable and limit participation. While minimum ages ensure a baseline of experience and development, there are no maximum ages for most positions, leading to ongoing debates about cognitive fitness for older leaders.</p>
