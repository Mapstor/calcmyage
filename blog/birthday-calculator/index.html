      <h2>How to Calculate Days Until Your Birthday</h2>
      <p>Calculating the number of days until your next birthday involves finding the difference between today's date and your next birthday date. If your birthday hasn't occurred yet this year, you count the days remaining until it. If it already passed, you count the days until the same date next year.</p>

      <h3>Manual Calculation Method</h3>
      <p>To calculate by hand, you need to add up the remaining days in the current month, the full days in each month between now and your birthday month, and the days into your birthday month. For example, if today is February 4, 2026, and your birthday is June 15:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Remaining days in February: 24 (28 - 4)</li>
        <li>Full months: March (31) + April (30) + May (31) = 92</li>
        <li>Days in June through the 15th: 15</li>
        <li>Total: 24 + 92 + 15 = <strong>131 days</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This method is tedious and error-prone, especially across year boundaries and leap years. Our <a href="/">birthday calculator</a> does this instantly.</p>

      <h2>What Day of the Week Were You Born?</h2>
      <p>Your birth day of the week has fascinated people for centuries. The nursery rhyme "Monday's child is fair of face" assigns personality traits to each day. While not scientific, knowing your birth day is a fun conversation starter.</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Day Born</th><th>Nursery Rhyme Trait</th><th>Fun Fact</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td><strong>Monday</strong></td><td>Fair of face</td><td>Named after the Moon (Moon-day)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Tuesday</strong></td><td>Full of grace</td><td>Named after Tiw (Norse god of war)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Wednesday</strong></td><td>Full of woe</td><td>Named after Woden (Odin)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Thursday</strong></td><td>Has far to go</td><td>Named after Thor</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Friday</strong></td><td>Loving and giving</td><td>Named after Frigg (Norse goddess)</td></tr>

      <h3>How to Determine Your Birth Day</h3>
      <p>Mathematicians have developed formulas to calculate the day of the week for any date, the most famous being <strong>Zeller's congruence</strong> and the <strong>Doomsday algorithm</strong> created by mathematician John Conway. However, the easiest approach is to use our <a href="/">calculator</a>, which shows your birth day instantly when you enter your date of birth.</p>

      <h2>The History of Birthday Celebrations</h2>
      <p>Birthday celebrations as we know them today have a rich and surprising history stretching back thousands of years.</p>

      <h3>Ancient Origins</h3>
      <p><strong>Ancient Egypt (3000+ BCE):</strong> The earliest recorded birthday celebrations were for Egyptian pharaohs, but these marked their coronation as gods rather than their biological birth. The pharaoh's "birth as a god" was the date they ascended to the throne.</p>
      <p><strong>Ancient Greece:</strong> Greeks adopted the Egyptian tradition and added the concept of birthday cakes. They baked round cakes to honor Artemis, goddess of the moon, with candles representing the moon's glow. Blowing out candles may have originated as a way to send wishes to the gods via the rising smoke.</p>
      <p><strong>Ancient Rome:</strong> Romans were the first civilization to celebrate birthdays for ordinary citizens (though only men, initially). They called it the "dies natalis" and celebrated with gifts, feasts, and good wishes. Female birthdays were not celebrated until around the 12th century.</p>

      <h3>Medieval and Religious Influences</h3>
      <p>Early Christians initially rejected birthday celebrations as a pagan practice. The Bible mentions only two birthday celebrations, both associated with negative events (Pharaoh and Herod). This attitude persisted for centuries in some denominations.</p>
      <p>By the Middle Ages, the Church began celebrating the birthdays of saints and eventually Jesus Christ (Christmas). This gradually made birthday celebrations more acceptable for common people, though elaborate celebrations remained primarily for royalty and nobility.</p>

      <h3>Modern Birthday Traditions</h3>
      <p>The modern birthday party emerged in 18th-century Germany with "Kinderfeste" (children's parties). German bakers invented the layered birthday cake, and the tradition of placing candles representing the child's age became standard. The song "Happy Birthday to You" was written in 1893, and by the mid-20th century, birthday parties had become a global phenomenon.</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Era</th><th>Birthday Tradition</th><th>Who Celebrated</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Ancient Egypt</td><td>Coronation celebrations</td><td>Pharaohs only</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Ancient Greece</td><td>Moon cakes for Artemis</td><td>Gods and goddesses</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Ancient Rome</td><td>Dies natalis feasts</td><td>Free male citizens</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Medieval Europe</td><td>Saint's day celebrations</td><td>Royalty, saints</td></tr>
            <tr><td>18th century Germany</td><td>Kinderfeste with cakes</td><td>Children of middle class</td></tr>
            <tr><td>20th century onwards</td><td>Modern parties</td><td>Everyone globally</td></tr>

      <h2>Famous Birthdays: Celebrities by Date</h2>
      <p>Every day of the year has notable people who share that birthday. Here are some of the most famous birthdays throughout the year:</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">

      <h2>Birthday Statistics and Probabilities</h2>
      <p>Birthdays follow fascinating statistical patterns that reveal insights about human reproduction, culture, and biology.</p>

      <h3>The Birthday Paradox</h3>
      <p>One of the most famous results in probability theory: in a group of just <strong>23 people</strong>, there's a greater than 50% chance that two share the same birthday. With 70 people, the probability exceeds 99.9%. This counterintuitive result occurs because you're comparing every possible pair, not just comparing against one specific person.</p>

      <h3>Most Common Birthdays</h3>
      <p>Not all birthdays are equally common. In the United States, September birthdays dominate, with September 9 and September 19 frequently ranking as the most common birth dates. This means a disproportionate number of conceptions happen around Christmas and New Year's.</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Most Common Dates</th><th>Least Common Dates</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>September 9</td><td>December 25 (Christmas)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2</td><td>September 19</td><td>January 1 (New Year's)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3</td><td>September 12</td><td>February 29 (Leap Day)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4</td><td>September 17</td><td>July 4 (Independence Day)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>5</td><td>September 10</td><td>December 24 (Christmas Eve)</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>The least common birthday is February 29 (only occurs in leap years), followed by major holidays when scheduled cesarean sections and induced labors are typically avoided.</p>

      <h2>Zodiac Signs by Birthday</h2>
      <p>Your birthday determines your Western zodiac sign, based on the position of the Sun at the time of your birth. Each sign spans roughly 30 days:</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Zodiac Sign</th><th>Date Range</th><th>Element</th></tr></thead>

            <tr><td>Scorpio</td><td>October 23 - November 21</td><td>Water</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Sagittarius</td><td>November 22 - December 21</td><td>Fire</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Capricorn</td><td>December 22 - January 19</td><td>Earth</td></tr>

          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h2>Chinese Zodiac by Birth Year</h2>
      <p>The Chinese zodiac assigns an animal to each year in a 12-year cycle. Your birth year determines your animal sign:</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">

      <h2>Special Types of Birthdays</h2>
      <p>Beyond your annual birthday, there are several special birthday types worth knowing about:</p>

      <h3>Golden Birthday</h3>
      <p>Your golden birthday (also called champagne birthday or lucky birthday) is when your age matches the day of the month you were born. If you were born on the 15th, your golden birthday is when you turn 15. If you were born on the 3rd, it happens at age 3 (which means most people with low birth dates miss celebrating it consciously).</p>

      <h3>Half Birthday</h3>
      <p>Your half birthday falls exactly 6 months after your actual birthday. Some families celebrate half birthdays for children born near holidays (like December babies who want a summer celebration). To find your half birthday, add 6 months to your birth month, adjusting for different month lengths.</p>

      <h3>Diamond Birthday</h3>
      <p>Your diamond birthday is when your age matches the last two digits of your birth year. For someone born in 1990, their diamond birthday would be at age 90. For someone born in 2005, it would be at age 5 (already passed for most).</p>

      <h3>Leap Year Birthday</h3>
      <p>People born on February 29 (leaplings) only have a "real" birthday once every 4 years. In non-leap years, they typically celebrate on February 28 or March 1. There are approximately 5 million leap day babies worldwide. Technically, a 40-year-old leapling has only celebrated 10 actual birthdays. Read our complete guide to <a href="/blog/leap-year-birthday/">leap year birthdays</a> for legal implications and celebration tips.</p>

      <h3>Platinum Birthday</h3>
      <p>Your platinum birthday is when your age equals the last two digits of your birth year. For someone born in 1985, their platinum birthday would be at age 85. For someone born in 2015, it happens at age 15.</p>

      <h3>Beddian Birthday</h3>
      <p>A Beddian birthday (named after scientist Albert Beddian) occurs when your age and the last two digits of your birth year are the same. This happens twice in most lifetimes: once when you are young and once later in life. For example, someone born in 2000 had their first Beddian birthday in 2000 (age 0) and will have their second in 2050 (age 50).</p>

      <h2>Birthday Traditions Around the World</h2>

      <h2>Birthday Numbers and Numerology</h2>
      <p>Your birthday contains several numbers that people find meaningful:</p>

      <h3>Life Path Number</h3>
      <p>In numerology, your life path number is calculated by reducing your full birth date to a single digit. For example, someone born on July 15, 1990: 7 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 0 = 32, then 3 + 2 = <strong>5</strong>. Each number 1-9 carries specific meanings in numerological traditions.</p>

      <h3>Birthday Number</h3>
      <p>Your birthday number is simply the day of the month you were born (1-31). In numerology, this is believed to reveal your natural talents and the impression you make on others. For double-digit dates, the digits are typically added together (e.g., born on the 28th: 2 + 8 = 10, then 1 + 0 = 1).</p>

      <h2>How Our Birthday Calculator Works</h2>

        <li><strong>Age breakdown:</strong> your age in years, months, days, hours, and minutes</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Birthday Cake Traditions by Age</h2>
      <p>The tradition of placing candles on a birthday cake dates back to 18th century Germany. The number of candles represents the person's new age, and making a wish before blowing them out is a universal custom. For milestone birthdays, many bakeries offer themed cakes with sparklers, number-shaped candles, or personalized decorations.</p>

      <h2>Fun Birthday Facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>"Happy Birthday to You"</strong> was written in 1893 by sisters Patty and Mildred Hill as "Good Morning to All." It became the most recognized song in the English language.</li>
        <li><strong>The most expensive birthday party ever</strong> was the Sultan of Brunei's 50th birthday in 1996, costing an estimated $27 million, featuring a concert by Michael Jackson.</li>
        <li><strong>Ancient Romans</strong> were the first civilization to celebrate birthdays for non-religious figures. Before that, only gods had their birthdays celebrated.</li>
        <li><strong>The tradition of birthday candles</strong> may come from ancient Greeks who lit candles on cakes to honor Artemis, goddess of the moon, making the cake glow like the moon.</li>
        <li><strong>About 385,000 babies</strong> are born worldwide every day, meaning you share your birthday with roughly 21 million living people.</li>
        <li><strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong> had two birthdays: her actual birthday (April 21) and her official birthday (a Saturday in June) for public celebrations.</li>
        <li><strong>In some cultures,</strong> babies are considered 1 year old at birth because the time in the womb counts as the first year of life.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Birthday and Health Research</h2>
      <p>Scientific studies have uncovered several interesting connections between birthdays and health:</p>

      <h3>Birth Month and Health</h3>
      <p>A 2015 Columbia University study analyzed 1.7 million patients and found correlations between birth month and 55 diseases. For example, people born in March had higher cardiovascular disease risk, while October births showed higher respiratory illness rates. These correlations likely reflect seasonal environmental exposures during pregnancy rather than astrological influences.</p>

      <h3>The Birthday Effect</h3>
      <p>Research has documented a small but statistically significant increase in deaths on or near a person's birthday. A 2012 study in the journal Annals of Epidemiology found that the risk of dying from a heart attack rises by 18.6% on one's birthday. Scientists attribute this to psychological stress, increased alcohol consumption during celebrations, and possibly postponement of death until reaching a symbolic milestone.</p>

      <h2>Most Common Birthdays: The September Peak</h2>
      <p>Birth data from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC's National Vital Statistics System (NVSS)</a> reveals a clear seasonal pattern in US births. September consistently dominates, with births roughly 10% above the annual daily average:</p>

      <h2>Average Age of Parents at Birth</h2>
      <p>The average age at which people have children has increased significantly over the past 50 years, affecting birthday demographics:</p>

      <p>This shift means today's children are more likely to have older parents, which affects family dynamics, grandparent relationships, and even genetic considerations. The average father's age has increased similarly, from about 27 in 1970 to 33 in 2025.</p>

      <h2>Birthday Calculation Formulas</h2>
      <p>For those interested in the mathematics behind birthday calculations, here are the key formulas:</p>

      <h3>Days Until Next Birthday</h3>
      <pre style="background: var(--gray-50); padding: 1rem; border-radius: var(--radius-md); overflow-x: auto;">
If birthday_this_year >= today:
    days_until = birthday_this_year - today
Else:
    days_until = birthday_next_year - today</pre>

      <h3>Day of Week for Any Date (Zeller's Congruence)</h3>
      <pre style="background: var(--gray-50); padding: 1rem; border-radius: var(--radius-md); overflow-x: auto;">
h = (q + floor(13(m+1)/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) - 2J) mod 7

Where:
h = day of week (0=Saturday, 1=Sunday, ...)
q = day of month
m = month (March=3, April=4, ... Jan=13, Feb=14 of previous year)
K = year % 100
J = floor(year / 100)</pre>

      <h3>Total Days Lived</h3>
      <pre style="background: var(--gray-50); padding: 1rem; border-radius: var(--radius-md); overflow-x: auto;">
days_lived = (current_date - birth_date).days

For approximate calculation without dates:
days_lived ≈ age_in_years × 365.25</pre>

      <p>These formulas are implemented in our <a href="/">birthday calculator</a>, so you do not need to calculate them manually.</p>

      <h2>Birthday Week vs. Birthday Month Celebrations</h2>
      <p>Birthday celebrations have evolved beyond a single day. Many people now celebrate their "birthday week" or even "birthday month":</p>

      <h2>Digital Birthday Celebrations</h2>
      <p>Social media and technology have transformed how birthdays are celebrated:</p>

      <h3>Facebook Birthday Phenomenon</h3>
      <p>Facebook pioneered the digital birthday message, with the average user receiving 20-80 "happy birthday" posts annually. Research shows that receiving birthday wishes on social media increases feelings of social connectedness, though the quality of relationship matters more than quantity of messages.</p>

      <h3>Virtual Birthday Parties</h3>
      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic normalized virtual birthday celebrations via Zoom, Google Meet, and other platforms. Many families continue to include virtual components for relatives who cannot attend in person.</p>

      <h3>Birthday Fundraisers</h3>
      <p>Platforms like Facebook and GoFundMe allow users to create birthday fundraisers for charitable causes. This "giving instead of getting" trend has raised billions of dollars for nonprofits worldwide.</p>

      <h2>Birthday Psychology: Why We Celebrate</h2>
      <p>Psychologists have studied why birthday celebrations matter to humans:</p>

      <h3>Developmental Significance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>For children:</strong> Birthdays help develop a sense of time, personal identity, and social belonging</li>
        <li><strong>For teens:</strong> Milestone birthdays (13, 16, 18, 21) mark transitions in identity and responsibility</li>
        <li><strong>For adults:</strong> Birthdays prompt life reflection and goal-setting</li>
        <li><strong>For seniors:</strong> Birthday celebrations reinforce social connections and life achievements</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Birthday Blues</h3>
      <p>Not everyone enjoys their birthday. "Birthday depression" is a documented phenomenon where individuals feel sadness or anxiety around their birthday. Causes include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unfulfilled expectations about life progress</li>
        <li>Reminders of mortality and aging</li>
        <li>Social pressure to celebrate</li>
        <li>Memories of difficult past birthdays</li>
        <li>Feeling unimportant if celebration is small</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mental health professionals recommend setting realistic expectations and focusing on meaningful connection rather than elaborate celebrations if birthday stress is an issue.</p>

      <h2>Age-Related Birthday Laws</h2>
      <p>Your birthday is not just a celebration; it is also a legal milestone. The exact time at which you "turn" an age has legal implications:</p>

      <h3>When Does Your Age Officially Change?</h3>
      <p>In most legal systems, you are considered to have reached your new age at the very start of your birthday (12:00:00 AM). This matters for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Voting:</strong> In the US, you can vote on Election Day if your 18th birthday is that day</li>
        <li><strong>Drinking:</strong> You can legally purchase alcohol starting at midnight on your 21st birthday</li>
        <li><strong>Driving:</strong> License exams can be taken on the birthday of eligibility</li>
        <li><strong>Contracts:</strong> A contract signed on your 18th birthday is valid as an adult contract</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Birthday and Insurance</h3>
      <p>Many insurance policies price coverage based on your age at the start of the policy. Car insurance rates typically drop at ages 25 and 65. Life insurance premiums increase with each birthday. Some policies use "age nearest birthday" (rounding to the closest birthday) rather than "age last birthday" (your current age), which can affect premium calculations.</p>

      <h2>Cultural Birthday Symbols</h2>
      <p>Different cultures have developed rich symbolism around birthdays:</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Origin</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead>

      <h2>Birthday Month Personality Theories</h2>

          <thead><tr><th>Month</th><th>Traditional Personality Traits</th><th>Scientific Reality</th></tr></thead>

      </div>
      <p>The only scientifically documented birth month effect is the "relative age effect" for September babies in countries with September school cutoffs, they tend to have slight academic advantages from being older than classmates.</p>

      <h2>The Birthday Paradox Explained</h2>
      <p>The birthday paradox is one of the most famous results in probability. It demonstrates that in surprisingly small groups, the odds of two people sharing a birthday are much higher than intuition suggests. The key insight is that you are not comparing against one specific date, but comparing every possible pair of people in the group.</p>
      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="data-table">
          <thead><tr><th>Group Size</th><th>Probability of Shared Birthday</th><th>Odds (Approx.)</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>5</td><td>2.7%</td><td>~1 in 37</td></tr>
            <tr><td>10</td><td>11.7%</td><td>~1 in 9</td></tr>
            <tr><td>15</td><td>25.3%</td><td>~1 in 4</td></tr>
            <tr><td>20</td><td>41.1%</td><td>~2 in 5</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>23</strong></td><td><strong>50.7%</strong></td><td><strong>Better than even</strong></td></tr>
            <tr><td>30</td><td>70.6%</td><td>~7 in 10</td></tr>
            <tr><td>40</td><td>89.1%</td><td>~9 in 10</td></tr>
            <tr><td>50</td><td>97.0%</td><td>~97 in 100</td></tr>
            <tr><td>60</td><td>99.4%</td><td>Nearly certain</td></tr>
            <tr><td>70</td><td>99.9%</td><td>Virtually guaranteed</td></tr>
            <tr><td>100</td><td>99.99997%</td><td>Essentially 100%</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>The mathematical formula is: P(shared birthday) = 1 - (365/365) x (364/365) x (363/365) x ... for each person in the group. With 23 people, there are 23 x 22 / 2 = 253 unique pairs being compared, which is why the probability crosses 50% so quickly.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer"><p>Your golden birthday is when your age matches the date of the month you were born. Born on the 25th? Your golden birthday is when you turn 25. Born on the 7th? It's when you turn 7. Also called a champagne birthday or lucky birthday.</p></div>

          <button class="faq-question">What is the most common birthday?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>In the United States, September 9 is consistently one of the most common birthdays, followed by other September dates. This pattern suggests a peak in conceptions around Christmas and New Year's. The least common birthdays are major holidays (December 25, January 1) and February 29.</p></div>

          <button class="faq-question">How do leap year babies celebrate their birthday?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>People born on February 29 (leaplings) have a real birthday only once every 4 years. In non-leap years, most celebrate on February 28 or March 1. Legally, the exact handling varies by jurisdiction, but for most purposes they are considered to have their birthday on February 28 in non-leap years.</p></div>

          <div class="faq-answer"><p>The birthday paradox states that in a group of just 23 people, there's a greater than 50% chance that two people share the same birthday. With 70 people, the probability exceeds 99.9%. It seems counterintuitive because people compare against their own birthday, but the math involves comparing all possible pairs in the group.</p></div>

          <button class="faq-question">How do I calculate my half birthday?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>Add 6 months to your birthday. If your birthday is March 10, your half birthday is September 10. For dates near the end of a month (like August 31), you may need to adjust since some months have fewer days (February 28/29). Half birthdays are popular for kids born near major holidays who want a summer or alternate celebration.</p></div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">How many people share my birthday?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>On average, about 385,000 babies are born worldwide each day. Since the world population is around 8 billion and there are 365 days in a year, roughly 21 million living people share your birthday. The exact number varies by date, with September dates being more common and holidays being less common.</p></div>

          <div class="faq-answer"><p>A champagne birthday is another name for a golden birthday - when your age matches the date of the month you were born. If you were born on the 22nd, your champagne birthday is when you turn 22. The term "champagne" suggests the special nature of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration. Some people extend this to include a "double golden" when your age is twice your birth date (born on the 15th, turning 30).</p></div>

          <button class="faq-question">Why is September the most common birth month?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/></svg></button>
          <div class="faq-answer"><p>September is the most common birth month in the United States because it corresponds to conceptions around the winter holidays (late December/early January). Factors include more time spent indoors during cold weather, holiday celebrations bringing couples together, and the end-of-year festive mood. The peak conception period around Christmas and New Year's results in a September due date approximately 9 months later.</p></div>

      <h2>Birthday Age Systems Around the World</h2>
      <p>Not every culture counts age the same way. Understanding these differences is important when calculating birthdays internationally:</p>

      <h3>Western Age (Standard)</h3>
      <p>In most Western countries, you are 0 years old at birth and turn 1 on your first birthday. This is the system used by our <a href="/">calculator</a> and throughout most of this guide.</p>

      <h3>Korean Age</h3>
      <p>In the traditional <a href="/blog/korean-age-calculator/">Korean age system</a>, babies are 1 year old at birth, and everyone ages one year on January 1st regardless of their actual birthday. This means a Korean age can be 1-2 years higher than Western age. South Korea officially switched to the international age system in 2023, though traditional Korean age is still used socially.</p>

      <h3>Chinese Lunar Age</h3>
      <p>Traditional <a href="/blog/lunar-age-calculator/">Chinese age counting</a> considers a baby to be 1 at birth (counting time in the womb) and adds a year at each Lunar New Year. This system is still used for zodiac calculations and traditional celebrations.</p>

      <h3>Japanese Age Counting</h3>
      <p>Japan historically used a system called "kazoedoshi" similar to Korean age, but switched to the Western system (man-nenrei) in 1950. Kazoedoshi is still sometimes used for traditional ceremonies.</p>

      <div class="table-responsive">
