This rule appears to have originated in late 19th century France and became popular in English-speaking countries in the early 20th century. It's purely a social convention, not a scientific or legal rule. Use our Age Difference Calculator to explore age gaps."

Biological age (also called physiological age) measures how old your body actually is based on various biomarkers. You can be chronologically 50 but biologically 40 (or 60) depending on factors like genetics, lifestyle, diet, exercise, and environmental exposure. Biological age is measured through tests examining DNA methylation, telomere length, and organ function. NIH research shows biological age is a better predictor of health outcomes than chronological age. Learn more in our Biological Age vs. Chronological Age guide."

For US passports, the State Department has specific requirements based on age at time of application."

    <!-- How Age Is Calculated -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>How Age Is Calculated: Methods Worldwide</h2>
      <p>Age calculation varies across cultures and legal systems. While most of the world uses the <strong>international age system</strong> (counting from 0 at birth), several East Asian countries traditionally used different methods. Understanding these differences is important for international travel, legal documents, and cultural awareness.</p>

      <h3>International/Western Age System</h3>
      <p>The most common age-counting system worldwide. You start at age 0 at birth and turn 1 year old on your first birthday. Your age increases by exactly one year on each subsequent birthday. This system is used for all legal purposes in nearly every country, including identification documents, voting eligibility, and legal age thresholds.</p>
      <p>The international age system is defined by <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISO 8601</a>, the international standard for date and time representation. When calculating exact age, we account for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Varying month lengths:</strong> January has 31 days, February has 28 (or 29), April has 30, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Leap years:</strong> Every 4 years (with exceptions for century years not divisible by 400)</li>
        <li><strong>Time zones:</strong> Your exact age depends on your local timezone at birth</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Korean Age System (한국 나이)</h3>
      <p>Traditional Korean age counting considers you 1 year old at birth (counting time in the womb) and adds 1 year on every January 1st, regardless of your actual birthday. This means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A baby born on December 31st is 1 year old at birth</li>
        <li>The very next day (January 1st), that baby turns 2 in Korean age</li>
        <li>Your Korean age is always 1-2 years higher than your international age</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> South Korea officially adopted international age for all legal and administrative purposes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_age_reckoning#South_Korea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 2023</a>. However, Korean age is still commonly used in everyday conversation and cultural contexts. Learn more in our <a href="/blog/korean-age-calculator/">Korean Age Calculator guide</a>.</p>

      <h3>Chinese Lunar Age (虚岁)</h3>
      <p>Similar to Korean age, the Chinese lunar age system (xū suì) counts 1 at birth. However, age increases at <strong>Chinese New Year</strong> (Lunar New Year) rather than January 1st. Since Chinese New Year falls between January 21 and February 20, the timing differs slightly from Korean age. This system is still used in traditional Chinese medicine, fortune telling, and the famous <a href="/blog/lunar-age-calculator/">Chinese gender prediction chart</a>.</p>

      <h3>Chronological Age (for Assessments)</h3>
      <p>Psychologists, educators, and healthcare professionals use chronological age expressed in a specific format: <strong>Years:Months (Y:M)</strong>. For example, a child who is 7 years and 4 months old has a chronological age of 7:4. This precise measurement is essential for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/chronological-age/">Pearson assessments</a> (WISC, WPPSI, WAIS)</li>
        <li>IQ and developmental testing</li>
        <li>Special education evaluations</li>

Your Korean age is typically 1-2 years higher than your international age. <strong>Important:</strong> South Korea officially adopted international age for all legal and administrative purposes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_age_reckoning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 2023</a>, though Korean age is still used culturally.
